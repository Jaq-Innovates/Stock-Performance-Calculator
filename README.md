# Stock-Performance-Calculator
This C++ program is designed to calculate the gains or losses from buying and selling stock shares through the iTrade online broker platform, factoring in a 2% commission fee on both the purchase and sale transactions.

Program Features:
User Input: The program prompts the user to input details about their stock investment, including:
Company name and stock symbol
Number of shares
Buying price per share
Selling price per share
Commission Calculation: It calculates the total commission paid on both the purchase and sale of the stock shares.
Gains/Losses Report: The program then computes the total cost of purchasing the shares, total proceeds from selling the shares, and the realized gains or losses, including the percentage gain/loss relative to the initial investment.
Sample Output:
The program displays a formatted report showing the stock investment details, total cost, total proceeds, commission paid, and the final gains or losses in both dollar amount and percentage form.

This program serves as a useful tool for investors to quickly assess their stock performance, including broker fees, and can be adapted or expanded for more advanced financial analyses.
